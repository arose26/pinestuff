Experiments in Pine Script


## Usage:
### pine_to_pinets
Converts Pine Script to [PineTS](https://github.com/alaa-eddine/PineTS) format.

`pip install pynescript escodegen`

`pine_to_pinets.py demo1.pine output.js`

This is a proof of concept. Pynescript dump is very slow and probably not useful for real-time parsing.
